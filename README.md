# Financial Filing Analysis
We have built a financial filing analysis system. The system contains four functions:
1. Downloading indexing file from EDGAR Server. (DownloadIndexFile.pl)
2. Searching the corresponding financial filing between certain years and then generating the downloading list, such as 10K, 8K, 10Q. (SearchFilingByType.pl)
3. Downloading the financial filing with given downloading lists. (DownloadFiling.pl)
4. Counting the number of appearances of certain keywords in the filings and generating reports in certain formats. (AnalyzeFiling.pl)
